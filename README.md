# DevPT Recipe Book

This is a food repository, made by and for all the foodies that hang at DevPT Discord's server in the culinary section.

All the recipes use [Cooklang format](https://cooklang.org/).

## Requirements

To use this vault you need:

- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) installed on your machine.
- The **Cooklang Editor** plugin enabled in Obsidian (search for `cooklang-obsidian` in Community Plugins).

Once Obsidian is installed, open this folder as a vault and enable the plugin so `.cook` recipes render correctly.

## Vault structure

The vault is split into two main parts:

- **Fundamentals** – culinary fundamentals such as techniques, ingredients, flavor, equipment, and kitchen workflows.
- **Recipes** – Cooklang recipes, organized into categories (appetizers, mains, desserts, etc.).

Current top‑level folders:
